# Telegram Receipt Sender Implementation

## Overview
Automated delivery receipt system that sends formatted order receipts to customers via Telegram when orders are marked as delivered by merchants.

## Implementation Status: ✅ Complete

### Components Created

#### 1. **Receipt Sender Module** (`backend/bot/SendingReceipt.py`)

**Main Function: `send_receipt_to_customer(bot, order_id)`**
- Fetches order details, items, customer, and merchant information
- Generates formatted receipt with:
  - Order code and date
  - Merchant name
  - Itemized list with quantities and prices
  - Order summary (subtotal, discount, delivery fee, total)
  - Payment method and status
  - Delivery information
  - Success confirmation message
- Sends receipt via Telegram with inline keyboard buttons:
  - ⭐ Write a Review (web app link)
  - 🛍️ Shop Again (web app link)
  - 💬 Contact Support (callback)
- Updates `receipt_sent_at` timestamp in database
- Comprehensive error handling and logging

**Additional Function: `send_receipt_for_multiple_orders(bot, order_ids)`**
- Batch processing for multiple orders
- Returns success/failure counts and error details

#### 2. **Bot Manager Utility** (`backend/app/utils/bot_manager.py`)

**Purpose:** Singleton pattern for accessing Telegram bot instance

**Functions:**
- `get_bot()` - Returns global bot instance (creates if needed)
- `send_telegram_message()` - Helper for sending messages

#### 3. **Integration with Orders API** (`backend/app/routes/orders.py`)

**Updated Endpoint: `PATCH /api/orders/{order_id}/status`**
- Detects when order status changes to 'delivered'
- Schedules receipt sending as FastAPI background task
- Non-blocking - status update succeeds even if receipt fails
- Comprehensive logging for debugging

**Code Changes:**
```python
# When status changes to 'delivered'
if new_status == "delivered" and old_status != "delivered":
    try:
        bot = get_bot()
        background_tasks.add_task(send_receipt_to_customer, bot, order_id)
        logger.info(f"Scheduled receipt sending for order {order_id}")
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"Failed to schedule receipt for order {order_id}: {str(e)}")
```

#### 4. **Database Migration** (`backend/add_receipt_sent_column.py`)

**Changes to `orders` table:**
- Added column: `receipt_sent_at TIMESTAMP NULL`
- Added index: `idx_orders_receipt_sent`
- Migration checks if column exists before adding
- Safe to run multiple times (idempotent)

## Technical Details

### Database Queries

**Order Query:**
```sql
SELECT
    o.id, o.order_code, o.subtotal, o.discount_amount, o.delivery_fee, o.total,
    o.payment_method, o.payment_status,
    o.delivery_address, o.delivery_name, o.delivery_phone, o.delivery_province,
    o.created_at, o.updated_at,
    u.telegram_id, u.name as customer_name, u.username as customer_username,
    m.name as merchant_name, m.phone as merchant_phone
FROM orders o
JOIN users u ON o.user_id = u.id
JOIN merchants m ON o.merchant_id = m.id
WHERE o.id = %s
```

**Items Query:**
```sql
SELECT
    oi.quantity, oi.unit_price, oi.subtotal,
    oi.product_name, oi.selected_variants
FROM order_items oi
WHERE oi.order_id = %s
ORDER BY oi.id
```

### Error Handling

**Receipt Sender:**
- ✅ Validates order exists
- ✅ Validates customer has Telegram ID
- ✅ Validates order has items
- ✅ Handles JSON parsing errors for variants
- ✅ Handles date formatting edge cases
- ✅ Comprehensive logging (info, warning, error)
- ✅ Returns success/failure boolean

**API Integration:**
- ✅ Background task prevents blocking API response
- ✅ Status update succeeds even if receipt fails
- ✅ Errors logged but not exposed to merchant
- ✅ Non-critical failure - order is already delivered

## Testing Checklist

### Unit Testing:
- [ ] Test receipt generation with minimal order
- [ ] Test receipt with discount applied
- [ ] Test receipt with free delivery
- [ ] Test receipt with product variants
- [ ] Test error handling (no telegram_id)
- [ ] Test error handling (no items)
- [ ] Test batch processing function

### Integration Testing:
- [x] Database migration runs successfully
- [ ] Receipt sent when status changes to 'delivered'
- [ ] Receipt not sent for other status changes
- [ ] Receipt only sent once per order
- [ ] Inline buttons work correctly
- [ ] Telegram message formatting displays properly

### End-to-End Testing:
- [ ] Merchant marks order as delivered in dashboard
- [ ] Customer receives receipt in Telegram within seconds
- [ ] Customer can click "Write Review" button
- [ ] Customer can click "Shop Again" button
- [ ] Customer can click "Contact Support" button
- [ ] `receipt_sent_at` timestamp is recorded

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

Required in `.env`:
```env
TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=your_bot_token_here
WEB_APP_URL=https://your-miniapp-url.com
```

### Dependencies

**Python Packages:**
```
python-telegram-bot>=20.0
```

Already installed as part of bot implementation.

## Usage Examples

### Manual Receipt Sending (for testing)

```python
from bot.SendingReceipt import send_receipt_to_customer
from app.utils.bot_manager import get_bot
import asyncio

# Get bot instance
bot = get_bot()

# Send receipt for order ID 123
asyncio.run(send_receipt_to_customer(bot, 123))
```

### Batch Receipt Sending

```python
from bot.SendingReceipt import send_receipt_for_multiple_orders
from app.utils.bot_manager import get_bot
import asyncio

bot = get_bot()
order_ids = [123, 124, 125]

results = asyncio.run(send_receipt_for_multiple_orders(bot, order_ids))
print(f"Success: {results['success']}, Failed: {results['failed']}")
print(f"Errors: {results['errors']}")
```

## Logging

**Log Levels:**
- `INFO`: Receipt sent successfully
- `WARNING`: Order found but has issues (no telegram_id, no items)
- `ERROR`: Receipt sending failed with exception

**Example Logs:**
```
INFO: Scheduled receipt sending for order 123
INFO: Receipt sent successfully for order 123 to user 456789012
WARNING: Order 124 has no Telegram ID for customer
ERROR: Failed to send receipt for order 125: Connection timeout
```

- [ ] Personalized product recommendations in receipt
- [ ] Loyalty points display in receipt
- [ ] Automatic review request after 3 days

## Troubleshooting

### Receipt Not Sent

**Check:**
1. Is order status actually 'delivered'?
2. Does customer have a telegram_id?
3. Is TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN configured correctly?
4. Check application logs for errors
5. Verify bot has permission to message user

**Debug Query:**
```sql
SELECT id, order_code, status, receipt_sent_at, user_id
FROM orders
WHERE id = {order_id};

SELECT telegram_id FROM users WHERE id = {user_id};
```

### Bot Token Issues

```bash
# Test bot token
python -c "
from telegram import Bot
from app.config import settings
bot = Bot(token=settings.TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN)
import asyncio
asyncio.run(bot.get_me())
"
```

### Database Column Missing

```bash
# Re-run migration
cd backend
python add_receipt_sent_column.py
```

## Security Considerations

✅ **Implemented:**
- Merchant authentication required for status update
- Merchant can only update their own orders
- Background task doesn't expose errors to API response
- Telegram bot token stored in environment variables
- No sensitive data logged in error messages

⚠️ **Best Practices:**
- Keep TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN secret
- Use HTTPS for WEB_APP_URL in production
- Rate limit status update endpoint
- Monitor for spam/abuse
